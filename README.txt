This sub-system was created from the ACMM DRAMA Template.  Please modify
as required to create your DRAMA task.

Note - you can switch to using C++ by renaming the files appropiately
and editing "dmakefile" to change the macro name "DramaProgramTarget"
to "DramaCPPProgramTarget"

<<Insert a description of this sub-system here.  Leave the lower part alone>>

------------------------------------------------
This software has made use of the ESO cmm system (known internally
at AAO as "acmm").  

This module is a DRAMA module - it must have a dmakefile and not
a Makefile.  This will be checked when you archive the module.
