2dF CAN Task.
==============
Controls the CANBus-based version of the 2dF positioner. Written by Keith Shortridge in 2018 around
the time of the AAO Transition, controlling the 2dF Robot Simulator Hardware (physical hardware, not
a software simulator) as a template on how to rework 2dF for control via  CANBus based electronics
hardware.
